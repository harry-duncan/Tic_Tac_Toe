# Project ZERO 
## Tic_Tac_Toe


This is my tic tact toe game that I built using JavaScript / jQuery / HTML & CSS
You can find the game online [here](http://harry-duncan.github.io/Tic_Tac_Toe/ "Tic Tac Toe") hosted thanks to Github Pages

## Approach taken

I broke this down into smaller problems and sloved them one at a time and learnt a fuckload along the way
there is still a couple of tiny bugs i can't figure out 

## Shoutout
To colin and ben for helping me work with jQuery as I fucking suck at it.
Also Wolf for being helpful and the best bug catcher out.
